Minecraft 1.5.2 tutorial src code updated to 1.6.1

Hi all, i have added this github so you can compare you code to mine. There is 2 foders on here, one is the basic biome
with trees and the other is the multi biome with trees.
I will add more to this, like custom sky, maybe a dimension like the aether/end with more islands, ore generation, 
structure generation and adding custom mobs :/
This is almost the same code as 1.5.2 but the textures are a bit dfferent as you know. This code can still be used for
1.5.2 as its mostly texture changes.
Hope it helps you all out.
Trees(i added the tree gen via the chunk provider as this way it lags a lot less if you have a lot of trees). Im looking
into adding the trees via this biome like minecraft does and will add the cde when complete.

ps.... i will be updatig this soon to 1.6.2 aswell.
